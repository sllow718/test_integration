# Pokémon Dictionary — Next.js Example

This is a minimal Next.js app that lists the first 151 Pokémon, allows viewing details (image + stats), and liking a Pokémon (stored in `localStorage`).

Quick start

```bash
cd /workspaces/test_integration
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

Notes
- Data is fetched from the public PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co).
- Likes are saved in the browser's `localStorage` per Pokémon name.
