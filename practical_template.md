## Example Practical: Introduction Lab — Simple Data Analysis (Sample)

Course / Module: Applied Data Analysis

Practical Title: Compute Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation from CSV

Objectives
- Load a CSV file into a script
- Calculate mean, median, standard deviation for a column
- Plot a histogram and brief interpretation

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+; `pandas`, `matplotlib`

Materials and Equipment
- Starter dataset: `data/sample.csv` (contains a numeric column `value`)

Procedure
1. Open the provided `starter` folder.
2. Write a Python script `analysis.py` that reads `data/sample.csv` using `pandas`.
3. Compute mean, median, and standard deviation of `value`.
4. Produce a histogram and save it as `histogram.png`.
5. Write a short report (1 page) interpreting the distribution.

Data / Observations
- Use the table above to record any notable values or anomalies.

Calculations and Analysis
- Provide the computed statistics and a screenshot of the histogram.

Results
- Provide final statistics and short paragraph conclusions.

Assessment
- Correctness of computations and plot: 60%
- Clarity of the report: 30%
- Code organization and comments: 10%

Instructor Notes
- Expected mean ~ X, median ~ Y (fill after reviewing dataset).
